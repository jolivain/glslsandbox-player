AT_COLOR_TESTS

#
# Testsuite is using the following netpbm programs:
#
# ppmhist (since 1989, space at end-of-line seems new in 2006 10.7, svn r2692)
# pnmcut (since 1989)
# pamundice (since 2007, 10.39.00)
# pamvalidate (since 2014, 10.66.00)
# pamfile (since 1991)
# pnmscale (since 22nov89)
# pngtopnm (added in 2000, 8.1)
# pgmtoppm (same as pngtopnm)
# psnpsnr (added in 2000, 9.6)
#
# Since some of those programs are relatively recent, the test relying
# on this particular program will be skipped, if the program is missing.
